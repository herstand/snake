# Snake Game

- The game is hosted at http://www.herstand.com/snake
- The code is hosted at https://github.com/micahherstand/snake
- The game loads once index.html loads.
- The game board will fill whatever size document it is loaded within-this would allow it to be easily embedded in an iframe.
- The snake starts at the center, moving right.
- The game can be paused/played with the spacebar.
- As a handicap (for viewability as much as gameplay), the apple has a 5 pixel radiusâ€”the snake will eat it if it hits anywhere within this radius.
- The snake is only one pixel thick. If I had more time I would make the thickness of the snake a user-defined feature, since it's hard to see on a large screen.
- The snake dies when it hits a wall or itself.
- The game restarts automatically when the snake dies
- If I had more time I would add a high score (number of apples eaten)
